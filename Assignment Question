IRCTC

You are an avid traveler and are on a mission to travel the India and explore its beautiful cities.

You decide to take this journey by train and you came across this website IRCTC. Being a backend engineer you 
try to build this as a project to understand how models would have been working.

Complete the IRCTC code from the template.

Explanations :

In Train Model : String route means a concatenation of the different Stations in a String format Suppose 
in Enum there are 6 stations A,B,C,D,E,F and train goes from B to D and then to A The route String will be like “B,D,A”

In AddTrainEntryDto : The attribute contains the list of enum values of stations that will be sent from the postman. 
0th index value will denote the start station and 1 index the next station and so on, converting these list items into a String route.

departureTime : This is the time it takes to start from the first station and to reach the next station it will take 1 hour. 
You can safely assume that throughout the journey of the train on the route planned the date will never change, ie 
The train will start from the first station and reach the last destination within 24 hours and on the same date. (between 00:00:00 — 23:59:59) on any date.

In TicketEntity :

Fare System : Between every consecutive stations the price is 300 Rs. Suppose the route is A -> B -> C -> D. incase 
we want to go from A to C the price will be 600, in case we want to go from A -> D, the totalFare will be equal to 900 and so on.

Assumptions :

All the people who have booked under the same ticket will board the train from the same station.

Important pointers : Don’t use the Lombok Library (Getter, Setter,AllArgsConstructor,NoArgsConstructor)

You can’t change the existing code/cannot add any other Repository in the service Layer

Don't use the builder annotations in converters from Dto to Entity Objects. Create an object using a new keyword and set the attributes accordingly.
